// TODO(kwalsh) Refactor this entire file. For the factory, use one function,
// which returns a HostedProgram that isn't yet launched. From that, we can
// query the subprin name and then launch it. This way we only have to pass all
// the configuration variables once. Also, usa a struct to hold all the
// configuration variables. We can also avoid the silliness with returning
// temppath then taking it as a parameter in the very next call.

// A HostedProgramSpec contains all of the information that might be needed to
// start a hosted program. Some factories may not use all of this information,
// and the semantics of each field vary by factory.

	// a factory-specific way. If present, the first three are used for stdin,

	// from the tao host server.
